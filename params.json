{"name":"cccp","tagline":"Development/Branches of cccp Package (also hosted on R-Forge)","body":"This package contains routines for solving convex optimization problems with cone constraints by means of interior-point methods. The implemented routines are adopted from the cvxopt-software. The package imports the CRAN-package RCPP and links to Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. The package does contain a Rcpp-module.\r\n\r\nThe main function cccp() can be utilized for solving cone constrained LPs and QPs. In addition, the function can also be employed for solving LPs with non-linear constraints or nonlinear objective functions with nonlinear and/or cone constraints. Convenience functions for solving (general) risk parity portfolio optimizations, minimizing L1-norms and solving geometric programs are made available as functions rp(), l1() and gp(), respectively.","google":"UA-59494807-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
